description:The tool call timed out after 200 seconds because the file was too large and complex to edit in a single operation. This commonly happens when:

1. **File size**: The file contains too many lines or complex content
2. **Complex edits**: Multiple sections being modified simultaneously
3. **System resources**: The editing model needs to process too much content at once

## How to Avoid Timeouts:

### 1. **Break Large Edits into Smaller Chunks**
Instead of editing the entire file at once, break it into logical sections:

```bash
# Edit design tokens first
edit_file design-tokens.css

# Then edit utilities
edit_file utilities.css

# Finally edit components
edit_file components.css
```

### 2. **Use Incremental Edits**
Edit one section at a time:

```bash
# First: Add basic variables
edit_file target_file.css "Add CSS variables section"

# Second: Add utility classes  
edit_file target_file.css "Add utility classes section"

# Third: Add component styles
edit_file target_file.css "Add component styles section"
```

### 3. **Use Search and Replace for Large Changes**
For systematic changes across many lines, use `search_replace`:

```bash
search_replace file.css "old_string" "new_string"
```

### 4. **Create New Files Instead of Large Edits**
For completely new files, create them in smaller parts:

```bash
# Create basic structure
edit_file new-file.css "Basic structure and imports"

# Then append sections
edit_file new-file.css "Add specific functionality"
```

### 5. **Optimize Edit Instructions**
- Be specific about what to change
- Use clear, concise instructions
- Avoid editing multiple unrelated sections simultaneously

### 6. **Use File Splitting Strategy**
Break large CSS files into logical modules:

```
assets/css/
├── design-system.css          # Core variables only
├── utilities.css              # Utility classes
├── components.css             # Component styles
└── layout.css                 # Layout-specific styles
```

### 7. **Monitor File Size**
Keep individual files under 500-1000 lines when possible to avoid timeouts.

For your design system, I recommend creating it in smaller, focused files rather than one massive file. This approach is also better for maintainability and performance.
