-- JSON support for flexible document storage
-- Full-text search capabilities
-- Backup and replication built-in
```

### Authentication: Custom JWT + RBAC
```typescript
// Role-based access control with attribute-based filtering
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'super-admin' | 'factory-admin' | 'hr-staff' | 'auditor' | 'worker';
  factoryId?: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
  attributes: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### AI/ML: OpenAI API + Custom Models
```typescript
// Document processing and analysis
// Compliance prediction and recommendations
// Natural language processing for Khmer/English
// Automated CAP generation
// Risk assessment algorithms
```

### Deployment: Docker + AWS/GCP
```yaml
